                    <p class="subaboutp">Hello my name is Daniel Yang, I am currently 23 years old and reside in New Jersey. I have been trying to find a direction for the past few years of my life. With the helps of my friends I feel like I finally know the direction in which I need to go. They were the ones who introduced me to coding and right at the start I was captivated. I was able to express myself through creating things with lines of code. The interactive-ness of coding is what really draws me in, being able to watch the pages that you work on change in real time. It really gave me the opportunity to use my creativity to create something and being able to do so gives me excitement and motivation to pursue this as a professional career.</p>

I'm someone that played alot of sports back in highschool such as soccer, swimming, and football. Nowadays, i'm more about just staying fit overall. I enjoy going on hikes I go to the gym about 5-6 days a week. I also enjoy playing and learning different instruments. Some hobbies that i've recently picked up is reading which I really enjoyed in the past but haven't done in awhile. I also have tried my hand at cooking and found myself enjoying it alot. I'm always looking to look for new hobbies that I would enjoy trying.</p>
